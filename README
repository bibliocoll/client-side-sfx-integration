MPG SFX + jQuery + Yahoo YQL (in Aleph)

Working example
===============
http://aleph.mpg.de/F?func=direct&doc_number=000000323&local_base=rdg01&con_lng=eng

Installation instructions
=========================
Make the following third-party scripts available on your Aleph server:

http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/ (jquery.xdomainajax.js)
Change the Yahoo query from "select * from html" to "select * from xml" (SFX response is XML)
http://outwestmedia.com/jquery-plugins/xmldom/ (for IE bug) (jquery.xmldom-1.0.js)
For jQueries, you will need CSS-IDs in your full view - we use the built-in MARC/MAB-Field plus contents variables in full-999-body:

<span id="$0100">$0200</span>
and direct-head/full-set-head(-nobor):

<table id="vollanzeige" cellspacing=2 border=0 width=100%>
Place the following code into full-set-tail/direct-tail. 
You will need to customize the Jquery-Id-Selectors to the headings in col.8 in edit_doc_999 â€“ they are used by Aleph in full view as internal variable $0200. Change "my.sfx.server" to your SFX server url.
